    """1. READ the UDP_TX module before reading or using this one.

This module demonstrates receiving a transmission sent by the UDP_TX module
on a SOCK_DGRAM (UDP) socket.  This module must be started first, so that it
can publish its port address (5280).

2. Run this module before starting UDP_TX.

UDP_TX and UDP_RX will be started on separate (laptop OS) processes.
UDP_TX will prompt for a message, then transmit it to the UDP_RX module over the
loopback IP address ("127.0.0.1").

UDP_RX will receive the message and print it.
While waiting for a message UDP_RX to be started or to send another message, UDP_TX will print a line of "."s one every 2 seonds.
