    """ Computer Networks Lab 4: Introduction to Sockets.  UDP Transmit example.
This code only transmits a udp message to a known IP_address ("127.0.0.1") and port_number (5280)
The UDP_RX module recieves and prints messages it is sent.
In this example, the UDP_TX process is the client, because the port number of the server (5280) is known to it.
The server, runing UDP_RX, determines the client's port number from each message it receives.
